# Package 'geone'
This python3 project provides tools for goestatistics simulations:
   - gaussian random fields (GRF)
   - multiple-point statistics (MPS) - deesse wrapper

Note: most of the modules in this package can be run as a script ('\_\_main\_\_' scope) and provide an example by this way.

## Installation
To install the package (in your home directory): `python3 -m pip install install .`  
To uninstall the package: `python3 -m pip uninstall -y geone`

To install the package in development mode (enable editing): `python3 -m pip install -e .`

## Requirements
The following python packages are used by 'geone':
   - numpy
   - matplotlib
   - mpl_toolkits
   - pyvista

**Important note**:  
The package 'geone' includes a *deesse wrapper*, i.e. an *interface* to directly launch deesse within python. Whereas this wrapper is provided as an open source software (under MIT license), the deesse software itself is patent-protected by the University of Neuch√¢tel. Free licenses for deesse are provided on request, for non-commercial academic research and education only.

Note also that the deesse wrapper is built for python3.6 / python3.7 / python3.8.

## Examples
Various examples are provided in notebooks.
- Gaussian random fields (GRF):
